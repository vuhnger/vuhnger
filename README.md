## Hi there, I'm @vuhnger 👋

#### 🔭 I’m currently pursuing a MSc in Programming and Systems Architecture at the University of Oslo.

I'm interested in software engieering, distributed systems, networking, security, automations and NLP.

I also like to run. 🏃‍♂️

I've interned at [Bekk](https://www.bekk.no/), working as a full-stack developer on web application security for [Kartverket](https://www.kartverket.no/).

I've worked as a full-stack dev at [UiO](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/index.html), creating a monitoring platform for students.

I'm currently working with various tech initiatives @ [Dr. Dropin Bedrift](https://bedrift.drdropin.no/)!
